CLASS ATTENDANCE APP

This application simplifies the process for professors to keep track of student attendance during lectures. At the beginning of each lecture, students scan a QR code specific to the professor and course. Once the lecture concludes, the professor can view the list of students who attended and then save this list into a record, which is appended to the existing records for that professor and course. These records can be exported locally to mobile devices as Excel spreadsheets.

Application is available on google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ba.sum.fpmoz.pmaapp
